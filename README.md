BrightEyes Useful Headers
=========================

This repository is home to some useful header files for your Bright Eyes projects, as well as examples for them. These so far include:

~ letters.h: a header for easily displaying and moving letters and other symbols made in a 5x5 grid.

~ fonts.h: a series of arrays for use with letters.h that provide the alphabet and some other symbols.

BrightEyes Useful Headers
=========================

First off, a note: the Bright Eyes only has ~4100 bytes of space. These headers will take up a lot of that space, so use them wisely.

This repository is home to some useful header files for your Bright Eyes projects, as well as examples for them. These so far include:

~ letters.h: a header for easily displaying and moving letters and other symbols made in a 5x5 grid.

~ fonts.h: a series of arrays for use with letters.h that provide the alphabet and some other symbols.
